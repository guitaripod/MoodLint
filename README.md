# MoodLint

MoodLint is a GitHub Action that automatically checks the mood and format of your Pull Request titles, ensuring they are written in an imperative mood. It also validates the title prefix against a predefined list.

## Features

- Checks Pull Request titles for imperative mood.
- Validates title prefix (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`).
- Skips mood check for specific prefixes like `fix`, `refactor`, and `regfix`.
- Comprehensive reporting and examples to guide you in case of an error.

## Installation

To install MoodLint as a GitHub Action, add the following YAML configuration to your repository under `.github/workflows/moodlint.yml`.

```yaml
name: MoodLint PR Title Check

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, edited, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  check-title:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run MoodLint
      uses: your-username/MoodLint@v1.0.0
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and adjust the version tag as needed.

## Usage

Once the GitHub Action is set up, it will automatically run whenever a Pull Request is opened or updated. If the title does not comply with the imperative mood or valid prefixes, the Action will fail and log an error message.

## Configuration

By default, MoodLint validates PR titles against the following allowed prefixes:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `chore`
- `refactor`
- `regfix`

If you'd like to customize these prefixes, you can modify the `allowedPrefixes` variable inside the `src/validator/prefix_validator.go` file.

## Running with Docker

You can also run MoodLint as a Docker container. Here's how to do it:

1. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t moodlint .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run moodlint "Your PR Title Here"
    ```

This will execute MoodLint and check the given PR title.

## Development

To work on the MoodLint project:

1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MoodLint.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```

    ```
3. Install dependencies
